# JobMail AI - OA Email Detector

> **Never miss an Online Assessment invite again!**

A Chrome Extension that automatically detects and summarizes Online Assessment (OA) emails using Chrome's built-in AI APIs (Prompt API + Summarizer API).

## 🎯 What It Does

JobMail AI monitors your Gmail inbox and uses **Gemini Nano** (Chrome's built-in AI) to:

- 🔍 **Automatically detect** OA invitation emails from companies like HackerRank, CodeSignal, Codility, etc.
- 📝 **Summarize** email content to extract key details (deadline, platform, instructions)
- 🔔 **Notify** you instantly when an OA email arrives
- ✨ **Highlight** OA emails in your inbox with visual badges
- 📊 **Track** all detected OA emails in a beautiful dashboard

## 🧠 Chrome Built-in AI APIs Used

This extension showcases two of Chrome's powerful built-in AI APIs:

1. **Prompt API** - Classifies emails into categories (OA_INVITE, REJECTION, STATUS_UPDATE, OTHER)
2. **Summarizer API** - Extracts key information and generates summaries

All AI processing happens **locally in your browser** with Gemini Nano - no data sent to external servers!

## 📋 Current Capabilities & Limitations

### What Works Well
- ✅ Detects OA emails using subject lines and preview snippets
- ✅ AI classification works with available inbox data
- ✅ Visual highlighting and notifications function perfectly
- ✅ Keyword-based fallback ensures high detection rate
- ✅ All processing happens locally (privacy-first)

### Known Limitations
- ⚠️ **Email Body Access:** The extension currently analyzes subject + sender + Gmail preview snippet (~100-150 chars). Full email body retrieval would require opening each message or Gmail API integration, which is beyond the scope of this hackathon MVP.
- ⚠️ **Summaries:** AI summaries are based on preview text. For detailed information, users should click through to the email.
- ✅ **Mitigation:** Strong keyword detection ensures OA emails are identified even without full content analysis.

### Why This Approach?
This design prioritizes:
1. **Performance** - Fast scanning without opening every email
2. **Privacy** - No external API calls or data collection
3. **Reliability** - Works immediately without complex setup
4. **Hackathon Timeline** - Functional MVP within 4 days

For a production version, Gmail API integration would enable full email body analysis.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- 📅 Deadline extraction and tracking with calendar integration
- 🌐 Multilingual support with Translator API
- ✍️ Email reply proofreading with Proofreader API
- 🎨 Multimodal support (analyze company logos)
